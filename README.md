### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urbanware-org/salomon-bsd/master/wiki/merge.png" alt="Merge" align="left"/>*Salomon-BSD* was officially merged into the *[Salomon](https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon)* project</a>

Once created from a fork of the original project, *Salomon-BSD* was merged with the *[Salomon](https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon)* project again after modifying and unifying the platform dependent code.

Thus, there is a single program for both platforms, *Linux* and *BSD*.

For this reason, this separate *Salomon-BSD* repository was **discontinued**. You can still download the latest version available before the merge, but there will be no new features, revisions or bugfixes.

If you want to view the old `README.md` from before the merge, see [here](https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon-bsd/blob/main/README_OLD.md).
