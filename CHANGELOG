
CHANGELOG (SaLoMon-BSD)

    Version 1.14.2 (2019-06-30)

        + Added debug feature for core scripts (these scripts can be modified
          without backup by copying them into a separate debug directory).

        * Revised the color table output (adjusted color information for pure
          text-based interfaces).
        * Revised the installation script (negligible changes).

        # Fixed the remove pattern case-sensitivity bug (the remove pattern
          was always case sensitive).

    Version 1.14.1 (2019-05-08)

        + Added an optional command-line argument (and feature) to highlight
          the filter terms additionally with uppercase letters (removed while
          porting due to issues).

        # Fixed the filter case-sensitivity bug (the filter terms were always
          case sensitive).

    Version 1.14.0 (2019-05-05)

        + Added some alternative file extensions for the global config file.
        + Added the shebang adjustment script (required in case the shebang
          inside the script files causes a "bad interpreter" error).

        * Revised the command check function inside the common core module.

        # Fixed the pattern parsing bug (using multiple semicolon separated
          terms did not work in general).
        # Fixed the possible shebang error in the compatibility script when
          performing the function test (replaced static string with an
          environment variable).
        # Fixed the signal (inter-process communication) bug (SIGINT was not
          handled correctly).

    Version 1.13.1 (2019-04-19)

        * Revised the usage information output (negligible changes).
        * Revised various command-line arguments (added short variants).

    Version 1.13.0 (2019-01-25)

        * First version of the BSD port (based on SaLoMon 1.13.0).
