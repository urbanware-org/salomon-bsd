
CHANGELOG (Salomon-BSD)

    Next release (outstanding)

        + Added a copy of the default config file (no manual copy required).
        + Added a shell pre-check core module (reduces code inside the main
          scripts).

        * Revised the compatibility script (added further checks and fixed
          inconsistent indentation).

    Version 1.16.0 (2019-12-12)

        + Added a command-line argument (and feature) to merge the input files
          when using analyze mode (useful for files containing lines starting
          with timestamps).

        # Revised (and enhanced) the code inside the output core module to
          provide a workaround for the OpenBSD limitations.
        # Revised some code in general (negligible changes).

    Version 1.15.0 (2019-11-15)

        + Added an option to the global config file to automatically set the
          width of lines (separators) based on the terminal size.
        + Added some code to validate the values from the global config file.

        * Revised the installation script significantly.
        * Revised the interactive mode (the main Salomon script does not exit
          after error dialogs anymore and returns to the previous dialog).
        * Revised the permission checks for given file paths (revised the
          already existing ones and added some new).

        # Fixed the line count bug when pausing the output (paused after the
          processed lines instead of returned lines).
        # Fixed the return empty files (blank lines) bug when analyzing
          certain files.

    Version 1.14.2 (2019-06-30)

        + Added debug feature for core modules (these scripts can be modified
          without backup by copying them into a separate debug directory).

        * Revised the color table output (adjusted color information for pure
          text-based interfaces).
        * Revised the installation script (negligible changes).

        # Fixed the remove pattern case-sensitivity bug (the remove pattern
          was always case-sensitive).

    Version 1.14.1 (2019-05-08)

        + Added an optional command-line argument (and feature) to highlight
          the filter terms additionally with uppercase letters (removed while
          porting due to issues).

        # Fixed the filter case-sensitivity bug (the filter terms were always
          case-sensitive).

    Version 1.14.0 (2019-05-05)

        + Added some alternative file extensions for the global config file.
        + Added the shebang adjustment script (required in case the shebang
          inside the script files causes a "bad interpreter" error).

        * Revised the command check function inside the common core module.

        # Fixed the pattern parsing bug (using multiple semicolon separated
          terms did not work in general).
        # Fixed the possible shebang error in the compatibility script when
          performing the function test (replaced static string with an
          environment variable).
        # Fixed the signal (inter-process communication) bug (SIGINT was not
          handled correctly).

    Version 1.13.1 (2019-04-19)

        * Revised the usage information output (negligible changes).
        * Revised various command-line arguments (added short variants).

    Version 1.13.0 (2019-01-25)

        * First version of the BSD port (based on Salomon 1.13.0).
