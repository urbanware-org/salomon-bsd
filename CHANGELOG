        + Added a command-line argument (and feature) to merge the input files
          when using analyze mode (useful for files containing lines starting
          with timestamps).

        # Revised (and enhanced) the code inside the output core module to
          provide a workaround for the OpenBSD limitations.

        * Revised the permission checks for given file paths (revised the
          already existing ones and added some new).

        # Fixed the line count bug when pausing the output (paused after the

          certain files.

          text-based interfaces).
        * Revised the installation script (negligible changes).

        # Fixed the remove pattern case-sensitivity bug (the remove pattern
          was always case-sensitive).

        + Added an optional command-line argument (and feature) to highlight
          the filter terms additionally with uppercase letters (removed while
          porting due to issues).

          inside the script files causes a "bad interpreter" error).

        * Revised the command check function inside the common core module.

        # Fixed the pattern parsing bug (using multiple semicolon separated
          terms did not work in general).
        # Fixed the possible shebang error in the compatibility script when
          performing the function test (replaced static string with an
          environment variable).
