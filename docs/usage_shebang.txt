    1. Definition

        The SaLoMon shebang adjustment script to set the correct shebang for
        the Bash shell in each script file.

    2. Shell requirements

        The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which
        is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least on many
        Linux distributions).

        No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell (version 4 or
        higher) must be installed in order to use the SaLoMon project. As a
        matter of fact, the SaLoMon project takes advantage of certain
        features provided by the Bash shell.

        Due to the shebang in the header of each script file, each component
        uses the Bash shell, even if the script is being run on another shell.

        The default shebang inside the scripts is the one needed on FreeBSD.
        In case the scripts will not run and return a "bad interpreter" error,
        simply run this script as it will automatically determine the path to
        the 'bash' binary and adjust the shebang inside all other SaLoMon
        script files.

    3. Adjust shebangs

        To adjust all the shebangs, simply run the shebang adjustment script
        without any arguments (there are no command-line arguments available
        anyway) and check the results.

            $ bash shebang.sh
